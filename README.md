# Project = Cost Quest
This project is a web game, hosted on heroku, that allows users to sign up for an account, then play a fun game of guessing prices of everyday electronics, gadgets, groceries and other items! Enjoy!

#Heroku deployment 
Heroku deployment link: https://secure-reaches-29983.herokuapp.com/

#Troubleshooting 
Note #1: If it doesn’t work in Chrome, try Internet Explorer.
Note #2: Because Heroku has limited dynos, sometimes the app crashes and needs you to manually restart it. This is done by: 
Go to https://id.heroku.com/login
Login using the following account info:
Email = thma4828@colorado.edu
Password = tsmarg$1998
Click on “secure-reaches-29983”
Hit “Open app” button in top right hand corner
If you get an “Application Error”, got back to the “secure-reaches-29983” page, then:
Hit the “More” button in the top right hand corner
Click “Restart all dynos” and confirm “Restart all dynos”
Wait a few seconds
Click “Open app”

#To play the game:
