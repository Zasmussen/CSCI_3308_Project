# Project Name = Cost Quest
This project is a web game, hosted on heroku, that allows users to sign up for an account, then play a fun game of guessing prices of everyday electronics, gadgets, groceries and other items! Enjoy!

# Heroku deployment 
Heroku deployment link: https://secure-reaches-29983.herokuapp.com/

# Troubleshooting: 
Because Heroku has limited dynos, sometimes the app crashes and needs you to manually restart it. This is done by: 
1. Go to https://id.heroku.com/login
2. Login using the following account info:
    Email = thma4828@colorado.edu
    Password = tsmarg$1998
3. Click on “secure-reaches-29983”
4. Hit “Open app” button in top right hand corner
5. If you get an “Application Error”, got back to the “secure-reaches-29983” page, then:
6. Hit the “More” button in the top right hand corner
7. Click “Restart all dynos” and confirm “Restart all dynos”
8. Wait a few seconds
9. Click “Open app”

# To play the game:
