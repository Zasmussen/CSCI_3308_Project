The Infinity Display has an incredible end-to-end screen that spills over the phone’s sides, forming a completely smooth, continuous surface with no bumps or angles.

Introducing the new SP-FS52 Floor Standing Speakers from Pioneer. Designed with uncompromising attention to detail, these speakers are ideal for home theater systems, offering remarkable audio quality from CDs, videos, gaming and any other audio source. Using three 5-1/4 inch woofers with oversized magnets for powerful bass, these speakers deliver the kind of high performance and exceptional quality that makes for a stunning music and home theater experience. Pioneer has been the industry leader in audio design and engineering firsts for over 70 years. Designed by Pioneer's Chief Speaker Engineer, Andrew Jones, these speakers embody all his high-end expertise and passion for pure audio reproduction. And while audio enthusiasts gladly pay as much as $80,000 for some of Andrew's designs, you'll find these new SP-FS52 speakers considerably more affordable. It's okay to stare. With true curved cabinet design, not only are the SP-FS52 Floor Standing Speakers aesthetically more pleasing, so is the entire listening experience. The high-performance and exceptional sound quality is the result of this stiffer design, which reduces standing sound waves inside the cabinet. As a literal example of the term "beautifully engineered", the elegant and appealing speaker grills on the SP-FS52s protect the speakers, but are also removable if you prefer to see the drivers exposed. Crossover: The job of the crossover in a speaker is to break the audio signal into low, high and sometimes mid-range frequencies. It's an important job, and it uses circuitry like inductors and capacitors to accomplish it. Much of the competition uses an extremely simple, low-cost crossover made up of a single capacitor and inductor.
